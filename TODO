# Payment Gateway

- Improved the argument  (working on)
- Add and validate args (working on)
- Start working on the DATA repository (done)

update the TDO to we can save the correct model to the database  (done)
* then lets write up some unit tests and get the ball rolling
Create a factory new func for the payment request

Within the Unit Tests we need to use the following to setup the payment

```
clientPaymentRequest := repository.NewClientPaymentRequest(data)
```




# Questions
Should we have separate types for CMD and repos DTOs?

We may wish to simplify the commands and abstract some complexity away from the user.
This will form the API RPC fields.

However, this means we need to map the CMD DTOs to the Repo DTOs.
This makes Naming conventions tricky. We need to be able to understand if we are working
with the  CMD or the Repos?

Maybe Repos DTOs should only be used within the Repos package?
But should we be sending CMD to the repos?
